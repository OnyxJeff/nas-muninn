**Muninn** is my household-wide **TrueNAS Scale** NAS server.  
It runs high-priority media and utility containers like:

- **Plex** – media server for movies and TV
- **Mealie** – self-hosted recipe and meal-planning app

This repo stores my Docker configurations and backup scripts for long-term reliability and re-deployment.
